### Description

The domain of the project, Dungeons and Databases, lies within tabletop gaming and gaming utility. In this domain, the database primarily focuses on organizing and tracking specific details within and between DND campaigns. It will model aspects such as character definitions and campaign progression, and maintain the accessibility of this information for online gameplay.

### Functionality of the Database:

The database within Dungeons and Databases will offer a range of functionalities to enhance the tabletop gaming experience. Users can store complete character definitions including their race, class, background, and items, enabling them to maintain countless detailed character profiles. It also supports the updating of existing character definitions to reflect progression in a campaign. For practical use, the project will allow users to generate basic character sheets using a query to the database, making it easier to reference character information during gameplay. Another unique feature is the ability to generate characters randomly or based on predefined parameters, facilitating the creation of new characters for future campaigns.

### Platform and Technology Stack:

Dungeons and Databases will be accessible through an online platform to ensure easy availability for long-distance gameplay. While specific technologies may vary, it could include web development tools like JSP or React for the front-end, and use back-end servlets and JDBC to handle database interactions and user authentication. The database itself will be built using a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL or Oracle to efficiently store and retrieve data. Overall, the project aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for tabletop gamers seeking to organize and enhance their unique character rosters.

### Tasks and Responsibilities:

1) Determine domain information to model in the database (what to display to the user, what options to provide etc.)  
~5-7 Days
2) Create a wireframe of the front-end to form a platform for the final design.  
~3-5 Days
3) Build up the front-end using HTML and CSS to display the model information.  
~5-7 Days
4) Set up back-end to connect to Oracle DB.  
~3-5 Days
5) Once Oracle DB is connected, use PHP commands to send queries from the front-end to the DB.  
~1-3 Days
6) Extra time alotted for design review and optimization for the demo.  
Using any remaining days

### Distribution of tasks:

Note: This is a very flexible, intitial estimate of the workload distribution and is subject to change.

Angus and Adwait : Responsible for setting up front-end using HTML and CSS and getting up to date with PHP.  
Max: Responsible for setting up back-end to connect to Oracle DB and sending queries.
